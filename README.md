# Predicting-Concrete-Compressive-Strength
This data science project aims to predict the compressive strength of concrete, a vital property for building stability. By leveraging machine learning techniques, domain knowledge, and the Concrete Compressive Strength dataset, the project streamlines the process of determining concrete quality.
